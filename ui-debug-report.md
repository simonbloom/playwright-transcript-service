# Playwright Service UI Debug Report

## Summary

This report documents the testing and debugging of the Playwright service for YouTube transcript extraction.

## Service Status

### Health Check
- **Status**: Healthy ✅
- **Circuit Breaker**: CLOSED (operational)
- **Cache**: 0% utilization (empty)
- **Queue**: 0 items waiting, can accept more requests
- **Rate Limit**: 30 requests available

### API Endpoints
- `/health` - Working correctly ✅
- `/stats` - Requires API key authentication ✅
- `/extract` - Experiencing timeout issues during transcript extraction ⚠️

## Browser Console Errors Detected

### During YouTube Page Load
1. **403 Errors**: Multiple failed resource loads (likely ads/tracking scripts)
   - These are normal and don't affect transcript functionality
   
2. **WebGL Warning**: GPU stall due to ReadPixels
   - Performance warning, not critical
   
3. **LegacyDataMixin Info**: Polymer framework message
   - Informational only, expected on YouTube

## UI Detection Results

### YouTube UI Version
- **Desktop**: Yes ✅
- **Mobile**: No
- **Polymer3**: No
- **Old Layout**: No

### Transcript Availability
- Video: "Rick Astley - Never Gonna Give You Up"
- Has Transcripts: **Yes** ✅

## Performance Issues Identified

### 1. Transcript Button Detection Timeout
**Issue**: The `findTranscriptButton` method times out after attempting multiple strategies

**Possible Causes**:
1. YouTube UI has changed, making selectors outdated
2. Button is loaded dynamically after initial page load
3. Button is hidden in a menu that requires interaction
4. Regional/account differences in YouTube UI

**Strategies Attempted**:
1. Direct button search (primary selectors)
2. Three-dots menu search
3. Description area expansion
4. Text-based search
5. Attribute-based search

### 2. Service Request Timeout
**Issue**: API requests to `/extract` endpoint timeout after 2 minutes

**Root Cause**: The Playwright browser automation is stuck trying to find the transcript button

## Recommendations

### Immediate Fixes

1. **Update Selectors**
   - Research current YouTube DOM structure
   - Add more flexible selectors
   - Implement fallback strategies

2. **Add Debug Mode**
   - Take screenshots at each step
   - Log DOM structure when button not found
   - Save page HTML for analysis

3. **Improve Error Handling**
   - Return partial results if transcript button not found
   - Add timeout configuration
   - Implement graceful degradation

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Visual Detection**
   - Use Playwright's visual testing capabilities
   - Implement OCR-based button detection
   - Use AI/ML for adaptive UI detection

2. **Multi-Strategy Approach**
   - Try different user interactions (scroll, hover)
   - Simulate logged-in vs logged-out states
   - Test with different browser configurations

3. **Monitoring & Alerting**
   - Track success rates per video type
   - Alert when detection strategies fail
   - Auto-update selectors based on patterns

## Memory Usage Analysis

- No significant memory leaks detected
- Browser instances properly cleaned up
- Cache manager working as expected

## Network Performance

- YouTube page load: ~3-5 seconds
- Multiple 403 errors (expected, non-critical)
- No rate limiting observed

## Test Coverage

### Tested Scenarios
1. Standard video with transcripts ⚠️ (timeout)
2. Invalid video ID ❌ (not tested due to timeout)
3. Long videos ❌ (not tested due to timeout)
4. Concurrent requests ❌ (not tested due to timeout)

### Working Components
- Browser launch ✅
- Page navigation ✅
- Video player detection ✅
- UI version detection ✅
- Transcript availability check ✅

### Failing Components
- Transcript button detection ❌
- Transcript panel interaction ❌
- Segment extraction ❌

## Conclusion

The Playwright service infrastructure is working correctly, but the YouTube UI detection logic needs updating to handle current YouTube layouts. The main bottleneck is the transcript button detection, which is causing request timeouts.

### Priority Actions
1. Update YouTube selectors based on current DOM
2. Add visual debugging capabilities
3. Implement timeout handling with partial results
4. Create selector update mechanism

## Appendix: Console Output Examples

```
[Browser error] Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 ()
[Browser info] LegacyDataMixin will be applied to all legacy elements.
[Browser warning] [.WebGL-0x1240048a100]GL Driver Message (OpenGL, Performance, GL_CLOSE_PATH_NV, High): GPU stall due to ReadPixels
```

These errors are non-critical and commonly seen on YouTube pages.
